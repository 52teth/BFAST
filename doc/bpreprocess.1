.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bpreprocess
is the first of four programs in the bfast system.
.
.P
There are two types of output files generated by this program.
The first type is an index used in subsequent searches by
\fBbmatches\fR.
The second type is a binary format for the reference genome.
The generation of the second type is not yet implemented.
.
.P
To generate an index (\fB\-a 0\fR), the reference genome sequence must be given (see \fB\-r\fR).
The number of indexes to be generated and their respective layouts must also be given (see \fB\-i\fR).
The index does not have to range over the whole-genome, and can be narrowed to a range be using options \fB\-s\fR, \fB\-S\fR, \fB\-e\fR and \fB\-E\fR to specify start chromosome and position as well as end chromosome and position for the range.
If you are using a multi-core and/or a multi-processor machine, it is beneficial to specify the number of threads (see \fB\-n\fR) to match the number of independent processing units as to speed up the generating time.
It is recommended that the indexes be stored in binary format (see \fB\-B\fR) as to reduce disk space as well as speed up subsequent loading time.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 4
\fB\-r\fR \fIFILENAME\fR, \fB\-\-rgListFileName=\fIFILENAME\fR
The file specified contains the list of files specifying the sequence of the reference genome.
.
.TP 4
\fB\-i\fR \fIFILENAME\fR, \fB\-\-indexLayoutFileName=\fIFILENAME\fR
The file specified will contain the layout for each index that you wish to generate.
.
.TP 4
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-binaryInput\fR
This specifies that the reference files will be in binary format.  
This option is not yet implemented.
.
.TP 4
\fB\-a\fR \fIINTEGER\fR, \fB\-\-algorithm=\fIINTEGER\fR
This specifies what should be pre-computed.
If \fB\-a 0\fR is given, we will create an index according to the layouts (\fB\-i\fR) given.
If \fB\-a 1\fR is given, we will create binary files for the reference genome.
\fB\-a 1\fR is not yet implemented.
.
.TP 4
\fB\-s\fR \fIINTEGER\fR, \fB\-\-startChr=\fIINTEGER\fR
Specifies the beginning chromosome range to consider when building the indexes.
.
.TP 4
\fB\-S\fR \fIINTEGER\fR, \fB\-\-startPos=\fIINTEGER\fR
Specifies the beginning position range to consider when building the indexes.
.
.TP 4
\fB\-e\fR \fIINTEGER\fR, \fB\-\-endChr=\fIINTEGER\fR
Specifies the end chromosome range to consider when building the indexes.
.
.TP 4
\fB\-E\fR \fIINTEGER\fR, \fB\-\-endPos=\fIINTEGER\fR
Specifies the end position range to consider when building the indexes.
.
.TP 4
\fB\-n\fR \fIINTEGER\fR, \fB\-\-numThreads=\fINTEGER\fR
Specifies the number of threads to create.
Sorting of the index is required for fast look-up.
The speed of the sort will increase by a factor of \fB1/n\fR.
.
.TP 4
\fB\-o\fR \fISTRING\fR, \fB\-\-outputID=\fISTRING\fR
Specifies a string to include when naming the output files.
.
.TP 4
\fB\-d\fR \fIDIRECTORY\fR, \fB\-\-outputDir=\fIDIRECTORY\fR
Specifies the directory in which to output.
.
.TP 4
\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-outputBinary\fR
Specifies the output files should be outputted in binary format.
This will save considerable space and will improve subsequent loading times.
.
.TP 4
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-timing\fR
Output timing information for the execution of the program.
.
.TP 4
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-Parameters\fR
Prints the program parameters but does not execute.
.
.TP 4
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-Help\fR
Prints the help message.
