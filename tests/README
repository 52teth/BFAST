If you want to add some tests:

1. If what you are testing deserves its own test script, add it to the Makefile.am,
right before test.diff.sh

2. Write your test script. Use any of the current ones as a reference.

3. If you need to add some data for your tests, unpack data/data.tar.gz, add the
   file or files and re-compress the tarball.

4. Once your testing is completed run update.save.sh. That script will regenerate
   the md5s that are stored in the tarball.

5. Commit
