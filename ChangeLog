Please send bfast bug reports to nhomer@cs.ucla.edu

Version 0.5.3
* Added C implementation of solid2fastq.pl for faster fastq generation.
* Fixing bug in qseq2fastq.pl that did not complement but only reversed
the seconde end of a paired end read.

Version 0.5.2
* Fixing bug when searching secondary indexes (introduced in 0.5.0
when zlib use started).

Version 0.5.1
* Fixed a bug when trying to read in secondary indexes in bmatches.
* Updated make check for creating the distribution.
* Truncating the keysize now works in bmatches.
* Updated the default scoring matrix so that it does not need to be
specified.
* Updating gzreads and gzwrites for custom 64-bit support.
* Updating the maximum number of matches behaviour in 
* Adding in some new helper functions to calculate the power or sensitivity
of the alignments.

Version 0.5.0
* All output files now use the zlib for compression.  This includes brg,
bif, bmf, and baf files.
* Removed brepair and breport as they are now obsolete.

Version 0.4.7
* Updated output file naming in bmfconvert.
* Updated bug in balign regarding retrieving the substitutions scores.

Version 0.4.6
* Simplified the scoring matrix.  Now only match/mismatch is required for
input.
* Updated bug in color space local aligner if the color match score was
not zero. Also enforcing all color match and color mismatch scores
respectively to be the same to allow for an optimization in the algorithm.

Version 0.4.5
* Moved mapping quality calculation to balign.  BAF files have an extra
field specifying the mapping quality.  For 0.4.1-0.4.4 BAF versions, use
fixbaf to convert them to 0.4.5 versions.
* Removed bfix - obsolete.

Version 0.4.4
* Fixed bugs when outputting to SAM format.
* Added bmf conversion to fastq.
* Fixed bug in RGRanges, where pallindromic sequences were being removed
from one strand.
* Added new utility brg2fasta.
* Added ability in bmatches to use masks that are prefixes of the mask (-k).
* Now can output a very rudimentary mapping quality in bpostprocess.
* Added a scripts folder to convert raw base/color calls to BFAST fastq
format.

Version 0.4.3
* Added an option to bpostprocess where all "best scoring" alignments
can be returned.
* Fixed bug where aligning perfectly did not retain repeat masker 
information in the reference.

Version 0.4.2
* Added support for SAM 0.1.2 output.
* Added new utility brepair, which tries to align unpaired reads. I 
would not recommend using it since it does not in my analysis help
too much in practice and is inefficient.

Version 0.4.1
* Adding support for quality scores.  The input reads now must be in
fastq or multi-end fastq format.
* Adding support for multi end reads.
* The names of Output files of bmatches, balign, and subsequent 
programs are changed.

Version 0.3.4
* Updated balign, bmfconvert, bafconvert, and bsort output file names.
* Added gff output in bpostprocess and bafconvert.
* Fixed bug in bpostprocess when specifying the maximum number of 
nt errors.
* bsort now performs a threaded sort if the maximum number of entries
is large.
* removed some options to do with choosing paired end reads in 
bpostprocess, since they are easily misinterpreted.
* added a uniqueness score option in bpostprocess, which will replace
the alignment score with a ratio of the chosen alignment score versus
all other alignments' scores.

Version 0.3.3
* A quick fix to remove a memory leak that can causes crashes
when aligning nt space data.

Version 0.3.2
* Updating how we report color errors in .baf files.
* Added a new utility: bmergesorted that merges two files that
have been sorted by bsort.
* Updated bsort to print more information while sorting.  Also,
updated bsort to sort bpostprocess unpaired baf output.
* Update berrordistribution and bpairedenddist to accept any
number of input files.
* Changed bgeterrordistribution to berrordistribution.
* Updated bpostprocess to output unpaired reads when one end
has ambiguity.
* Updated local alignment optimization in balign (-b).
* Updated bsort to take in the maximum number of entries for 
memory management.
* Fixed bug in balign where alignment could not handle switching
directly from an insertion to a deletion (or vice versa).

Version 0.3.1
* Found bug in read simulator.
* Fixing more bugs to do with indels.

Version 0.2.6
* Fixed a bug in breport that caused memory leaks.
* Added support to output unpaired reads in bpostprocess.
* Fixed a bug in balign where the position of indels were
being reported incorrectly for NT space.  This was as a result
of incorporating color space code incorrectly.

Version 0.2.5
* bpairedenddist now outputs to a file instead of stdout.
* Added a new utility balignsim which tests the accuracy of 
various local alignment algorithms implemented by balign.
* Fixed bug in balign when considering indels for color space.

Version 0.2.4
* Added a .sh script to update the tests since the reference
genome files and index files have their version numbers embedded.
* Updated color space tests; there was a bug in reporting the 
reverse strand.
* Updated balign "Validatin outputID" message.
* Moved from using mktemp to mkstemp, which means no more mktemp
warnings.
* Added a new utility, bsort, which sorts a bfast reported file.
* Fixed off by two error for reverse strand in color space for 
bmatches.
* Fixed bug with paired end bmatches file as input to bevalsim.
* Fixed bug with calling insertions on the reverse strand.  The
offset was off by the two times the length of the insertion.

Version 0.2.3
* Updated bfix to include packed.
* Updated bug when reading a bfast reference genome file.
* Added "make check" functionality for regression testing.
* Fixed warning in Mac OS X complaining of unused argp structures.
* Fixed bug in Mac OS X where -r argument in bpostprocess caused
an error.
* Updated names of files generated by bmatches and balign.

Version 0.2.2
* Fixed major bug that was introduced in 0.1.10 where matches to 
the reverse strand were being erroneously included.
* Added check when making the indexes that the hash width is less 
than or equal to the key-size.

Version 0.2.1
* Major version change.
* Added option in balign to allow local alignment to only consider
mismatches and color errors.
* Removed memory leak in balign.
* begenerate reads now outputes a read number in the read name.
* Halved the required storage size of the hash in the index.
* Added butil utility bfix which will convert 0.2.1 < reference 
genome and index files to the current version.

Version 0.1.13
* Updated bug in RGIndex where reverse read could have n's.

Version 0.1.12
* bmatches: now option -w can specify which strand to match.
* bevalsim now takes in any bmf or baf file.
* Optimized part of bmatches procedure.  Both forward and reverse
matches wil count towards maxKeyMatches (-K).
* Updated bpreprocess help message.
* Updated bindexhist and bindexdist for color space.
* Fixed bug in bgeneratereads for color space.

Version 0.1.11
* bpostprocess now prints out MAF that complies with UCSC standards.

Version 0.1.10
* bmatches supports only matching to the forward strand.  This 
facilitates aligning methylated sequences.
* bpreprocess bug fixed when using an exons file.
* bevalsim now requires knowing paired end info and the original
reads file generated by bgeneratereads.
* fixed bug in bgeneratereads and bevalsim for paired end data.
* Fixed bugs in AlignEntryRead where the contig name was not being
read properly.

Version 0.1.9
* Updated bmf output to properly display when the maximum number
of matches has been reached.
* bmfconvert does not require paired end argument.
* Now supports trimming whitespace including carriage return on the
ends of the reads, mainly to support reads made on Windows machines.
* Updated butil binaries.

Version 0.1.8
* Updated to support Ns in the reads; will still ignore "."s.
* Adjusting bounds bug with -e option fixed.  Would not default to 
the correct end position.
* Updated command line parsing to avoid memory leaks.

* Update bpostprocess for paired end support: now tested.

* Removed extra "." in inversions file (bpostprocess).
* Updated btestindexes against small bugs and added optimizations.
