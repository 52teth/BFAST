Please send bfast bug reports to nhomer@cs.ucla.edu

Version 0.2.5
* bpairedenddist now outputs to a file instead of stdout.

Version 0.2.4
* Added a .sh script to update the tests since the reference
genome files and index files have their version numbers embedded.
* Updated color space tests; there was a bug in reporting the 
reverse strand.
* Updated balign "Validatin outputID" message.
* Moved from using mktemp to mkstemp, which means no more mktemp
warnings.
* Added a new utility, bsort, which sorts a bfast reported file.
* Fixed off by two error for reverse strand in color space for 
bmatches.
* Fixed bug with paired end bmatches file as input to bevalsim.
* Fixed bug with calling insertions on the reverse strand.  The
offset was off by the two times the length of the insertion.

Version 0.2.3
* Updated bfix to include packed.
* Updated bug when reading a bfast reference genome file.
* Added "make check" functionality for regression testing.
* Fixed warning in Mac OS X complaining of unused argp structures.
* Fixed bug in Mac OS X where -r argument in bpostprocess caused
an error.
* Updated names of files generated by bmatches and balign.

Version 0.2.2
* Fixed major bug that was introduced in 0.1.10 where matches to 
the reverse strand were being erroneously included.
* Added check when making the indexes that the hash width is less 
than or equal to the key-size.

Version 0.2.1
* Major version change.
* Added option in balign to allow local alignment to only consider
mismatches and color errors.
* Removed memory leak in balign.
* begenerate reads now outputes a read number in the read name.
* Halved the required storage size of the hash in the index.
* Added butil utility bfix which will convert 0.2.1 < reference 
genome and index files to the current version.

Version 0.1.13
* Updated bug in RGIndex where reverse read could have n's.

Version 0.1.12
* bmatches: now option -w can specify which strand to match.
* bevalsim now takes in any bmf or baf file.
* Optimized part of bmatches procedure.  Both forward and reverse
matches wil count towards maxKeyMatches (-K).
* Updated bpreprocess help message.
* Updated bindexhist and bindexdist for color space.
* Fixed bug in bgeneratereads for color space.

Version 0.1.11
* bpostprocess now prints out MAF that complies with UCSC standards.

Version 0.1.10
* bmatches supports only matching to the forward strand.  This 
facilitates aligning methylated sequences.
* bpreprocess bug fixed when using an exons file.
* bevalsim now requires knowing paired end info and the original
reads file generated by bgeneratereads.
* fixed bug in bgeneratereads and bevalsim for paired end data.
* Fixed bugs in AlignEntryRead where the contig name was not being
read properly.

Version 0.1.9
* Updated bmf output to properly display when the maximum number
of matches has been reached.
* bmfconvert does not require paired end argument.
* Now supports trimming whitespace including carriage return on the
ends of the reads, mainly to support reads made on Windows machines.
* Updated butil binaries.

Version 0.1.8
* Updated to support Ns in the reads; will still ignore "."s.
* Adjusting bounds bug with -e option fixed.  Would not default to 
the correct end position.
* Updated command line parsing to avoid memory leaks.

Version 0.1.7
* Update bpostprocess for paired end support: now tested.
* Added support for filtering each end by score for paired end reads.
* Removed extra "." in inversions file (bpostprocess).
* Updated btestindexes against small bugs and added optimizations.
* Added bgeneratedistribution to calculate error distributions.

Version 0.1.6
* bgeneratereads was not producing SNPs and errors properly.
* bmatches now supresses timing output when -t is not specified.
* bpreprocess memory leaks fixed.

Version 0.1.5
* Fixed bug in bpreprocess where the program crashed right before terminating.

Version 0.1.4 
* Updated bmatches output file name for the filtered reads.
* Updated bpostprocess output file names.
* Recoded btestindexes to support finding indexes for color space.

Version 0.1.3 
* Improved speed for index creation while specifying an exon-like structure.

Version 0.1.2 
* Added support for index creation while specifying an exon-like structure.

Version 0.1.1 
* First alpha public release.
